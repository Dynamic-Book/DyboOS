# DyboOS

We are exploring options for the underneath operating system running
the Dybo. For test purpose, it should operate on Raspberry Pi (ARM CPU
architecture). The OS will then be specialized for dual screens and
stylus end-user interactions.

## Alpine 
It is lightweight, security-oriented operating system.

A first test, operating Dybo on Raspberry Pi 5 and Alpine OS. The Dybo
app is executed in a X-Window less environment, directly from the
Linux frame buffer. The memory foot print is therefore very low to
operate the DyboApp.

## Raspberry Pi OS
It inherits the lightweight and efficient architecture of Raspberry Pi
OS while specialized for dual screens and stylus end-user
interactions.
